# Welcome to Harshita's Git🌸

Hello there! I’m Harshita, a curious coder, AI tinkerer, and occasional doodle enthusiast💁🏻‍♀️. I’m currently an ML Intern at the ADaMS Lab, where I work on training and analyzing machine learning models for applications in additive manufacturing and robotics. I'm also working on some personal projects that involve working with ML models,  optimization, web application development and building smart AI, that’ll help me grow as an engineer and explore what’s possible with intelligent systems.🤖
